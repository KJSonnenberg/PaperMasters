<h1>About Paper Masters</h1>              
<p><b>Paper Masters was started in 1998</b> in San Diego, CA in a 1 room office.
    Recognizing the need for a research and writing company that did only custom written research and reports, the small staff began hiring freelance writers to produce custom research. 
    By the year 2000, Paper Masters needed to branch out and was acquired by E World Publishing, Inc. and moved to beautiful Northeastern Pennsylvania.</p>

<p><b>E World Publishing, Inc. also started in 1998</b> as a small, family operation out of Hunlock Creek, Pennsylvania. 
    E World gave Paper Masters access to qualified, professional freelance writers and a large network of publishing professionals has spurred Paper Masters' growth from a family business to being recognized as the top custom academic research writing company in the world. 
    An Internet business for over 25 years, E World has gained a solid reputation as one of the premier research and writing companies in e-commerce.
